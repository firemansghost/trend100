# HANDOFF — Trend100

## Last Session Summary
Vercel deployment milestone recorded. Site is live at https://trend100.vercel.app/. Next.js app scaffolded with module structure. Project brain documentation updated to reflect deployment state.

## State of Work
Next.js app scaffolded with module architecture. Site deployed and live on Vercel. Ready to begin V1 UI development with mock snapshot data.

## Priority for Next Session
1) Create curated 100 ticker list + tag taxonomy as committed source-of-truth file
2) Build mock snapshot loader in `data/` layer
3) Build dashboard heatmap UI in `ui/` layer

## Open Questions
- Custom domain now vs later (trend100.com or subdomain?)
- Chart library choice: TradingView Lightweight Charts vs Recharts (for modal chart)
- Test runner choice (vitest vs jest)
- Regime label thresholds (what % green = Risk-On/Transition/Risk-Off)
